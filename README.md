PressBooks XML to Markdown Converter
====================================

A utility for converting books in PressBooks XML or WordPress XML format (as provided as a download option through the PressBooks web UI) to individual Markdown files for each chapter. Intended for converting open textbooks to Markdown from platforms that use PressBooks, such as [University of Minnesota Open Textbook
Library](https://www.lib.umn.edu/publishing/works/textbooks) and [BC
Open Textbooks](https://opentextbc.ca).

This tool is adapted from the
[exitwp](https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp) tool created by Thomas
Fr√∂ssman.

Getting started
---------------

- [Download](https://github.com/a-hurst/PressBooks2md/archive/master.zip) the project and unzip it.
- Download one or more books in PressBooks or WordPress XML format (e.g. [this one](https://open.lib.umn.edu/psychologyresearchmethods/)) and place them in the `book-xml` folder.
- Run the converter by typing `python exitwp.py` in the console from
  the directory of the unzipped archive
- You should now have all the books converted into separate
  directories under the `build` directory
